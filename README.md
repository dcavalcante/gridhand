# gridhand

<sub>Formerly published as `gui-tool` / `agent-desktop-interface`.</sub>

**Let an AI agent click any desktop app by naming a grid cell — not guessing pixels.**

A cross-platform Rust CLI for GUI automation: screenshots, window management, mouse and keyboard control, strict JSON in / JSON out. **Zero dependencies** — no crates, one small binary, direct OS APIs.

---

Built for AI desktop agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and friends), but it works fine as a general-purpose GUI automation tool.

**Why it's different:** agents are bad at guessing pixel coordinates from a screenshot, and every other automation tool makes them try. `gridhand` removes pixels entirely — it overlays a **labeled grid** with a crosshair at each cell's center, the agent names a cell, and the click lands exactly on that crosshair. Need more precision? Zoom into the cell for a sub-grid and name a sub-cell (`C7.F3`). It's the whole workflow in one line: **orient → zoom → click → verify.**

**It sees pixels, not an accessibility tree.** Most desktop-automation tools for agents find elements by reading the OS accessibility tree — which only helps when that tree *exists*, is *complete*, and is *correct*. `gridhand` never touches it. It works from the actual rendered screen, so it drives what tree-based tools can't see: games, `<canvas>` / WebGL apps, Flutter and other custom-drawn UIs, remote desktops and VNC, video, and any app with missing, mislabeled, or wrong accessibility data. **If a human can see it, `gridhand` can click it.**

Everything is hand-rolled against raw OS APIs — its own PNG encoder, D-Bus client, JSON output, and DEFLATE — so there are no crates to audit, no build surprises, and it runs natively on **GNOME/Wayland and KDE Plasma/Wayland** where `xdotool` and `pyautogui` give up.

<sub>End-to-end in a real browser — navigate, click a field by cell, type, and submit, no pixel coordinates anywhere.</sub>

## What it's for

Concrete things it's been used for:

- **Automating apps with no CLI or API** — drive GUI-only software (legacy tools, proprietary apps, installers, settings panels) the same way a person would, so an agent can script a workflow that otherwise has no headless path.
- **Debugging GUI applications** — let an agent open the app, reproduce a bug by clicking through it, screenshot each state, and read what's actually on screen — hands and eyes for the parts a log file doesn't capture.
- **Reaching what the accessibility tree can't** — pixel-precise grid zoom clicks targets in apps whose accessibility data is missing, incomplete, or wrong: games, `<canvas>`/WebGL, Flutter and other custom-drawn UIs, remote desktops, and video.

## Features

- **Grid targeting:** Overlay a labeled grid on screenshots with cyan crosshairs at each cell center. Click by cell label — no pixel coordinates. Supports recursive zoom (`B2.C1`) and between-cell targeting (`D3+E3`).
- **No accessibility tree required:** Targets purely from what's on screen — never AT-SPI, UI Automation, or the AX APIs. Works where the accessibility tree is missing, incomplete, or wrong: games, `<canvas>`/WebGL, custom-drawn UIs (Flutter, etc.), and remote desktops.
- **Contextual zoom:** Zoomed views show the target cell with a coarser sub-grid, surrounded by dimmed context from adjacent cells with parent-level labels for spatial orientation.
- **No dependencies:** Pure std Rust, direct FFI to OS APIs (CoreGraphics, user32.dll, D-Bus). Compiles to a single small binary.
- **Wayland support:** Works natively on GNOME/Wayland via XDG Desktop Portals + `window-calls`, and on KDE Plasma/Wayland via XDG Desktop Portals + KWin scripting.
- **JSON output:** Every command returns structured JSON, so agents don't have to parse text output.

## Grid Targeting

The full workflow — **orient → zoom → zoom → ... → click → verify** — in commands:

```bash
# Screenshot with labeled grid overlay (auto-scales: 16x9 for full screen)
gridhand screenshot --window-id 123 --grid --output /tmp/grid.png

# Zoom into a cell — shows sub-grid with dimmed context from neighbors
gridhand screenshot --window-id 123 --grid --cell B2 --output /tmp/zoom.png

# Recursive zoom for precision
gridhand screenshot --window-id 123 --grid --cell B2.C1 --output /tmp/zoom2.png

# Click at a cell center (moves + clicks in one step)
gridhand mouse click --cell B2.C1 --window-id 123

# Target straddles two cells? Zoom/click centered on the boundary
gridhand mouse click --cell D3+E3 --window-id 123
```

## Commands

### Screenshots

```bash
# Full screen
gridhand screenshot --output /tmp/screen.png

# Cropped to a specific window
gridhand screenshot --window "Firefox" --output /tmp/firefox.png

# Screenshot by window ID (cropped)
gridhand screenshot --window-id 2045481940 --output /tmp/app.png
```

### Window Management

```bash
# List all windows (returns JSON array of IDs, titles, PIDs, and bounds)
gridhand windows list

# Bring a window to front by ID
gridhand windows raise 1234567890
```

### Mouse

```bash
# Click at current position
gridhand mouse click
gridhand mouse click --button right

# Click at a grid cell center (moves + clicks in one step)
gridhand mouse click --cell B2 --window-id 2045481940

# Between-cell click (centered on boundary)
gridhand mouse click --cell D3+E3 --window-id 2045481940
```

All targeting uses `--cell` with grid references. There are no pixel coordinate commands — zoom the grid until a crosshair is on the target, then click.

### Keyboard

```bash
# Type text into focused window
gridhand key type "hello world"

# Press key combinations
gridhand key press "ctrl+a"
gridhand key press "alt+f4"
gridhand key press "super"
gridhand key press "ctrl+shift+t"

# Type into a specific window
gridhand key type "hello" --window "Terminal"
gridhand key press "ctrl+a" --window-id 2045481940
```

## Agent Integration

A skill definition following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard is included in `skills/gridhand/SKILL.md`.

**1. Add gridhand to your PATH** (after building):

```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/gridhand /usr/local/bin/gridhand

# Or without sudo
ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/gridhand ~/.local/bin/gridhand
```

**2. Install the skill:**

```bash
# Claude Code
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/gridhand
cp skills/gridhand/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/gridhand/SKILL.md

# Codex
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills/gridhand
cp skills/gridhand/SKILL.md ~/.codex/skills/gridhand/SKILL.md
```

## Install

Pick the easiest that fits. On **Linux and macOS** there's a one-time platform-setup step after you get the binary (input permissions, plus the GNOME `window-calls` extension when running GNOME; Accessibility + Screen Recording permissions on macOS) — see [Platform Requirements](#platform-requirements). KDE Plasma uses KWin scripting and needs no Gridhand-specific extension. Windows needs nothing.

**Prebuilt binary** (no Rust toolchain) — grab your platform's archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/ZachRouan/gridhand/releases/latest), then:

```bash
tar xzf gridhand-*.tar.gz                      # or unzip on Windows
sudo install gridhand-*/gridhand /usr/local/bin/   # or: mv … ~/.local/bin/
```

**From crates.io** (needs the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)):

```bash
cargo install gridhand
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZachRouan/gridhand
cd gridhand
./setup.sh          # detects your OS, does platform setup, and builds
```

After a **prebuilt or `cargo install`** on Linux/macOS, run the platform setup without rebuilding — either follow the manual steps in [Platform Requirements](#platform-requirements), or from a clone:

```bash
./setup.sh --skip-build
```

### Platform Requirements

|Platform   |Version      |Setup                                                                                                                 |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Linux**  |GNOME/Wayland, KDE Plasma 6/Wayland|`input` group + udev rule. GNOME also needs [window-calls](https://github.com/ickyicky/window-calls); KDE uses built-in KWin scripting (handled by `setup.sh`).|
|**macOS**  |10.15+       |Grant **Accessibility** + **Screen Recording** permissions in System Settings                                         |
|**Windows**|8+           |None (`cargo build --release` in MSYS2, Git Bash, or PowerShell)                                                      |

> The macOS **Accessibility** permission grants the right to *synthesize* mouse/keyboard input (post `CGEvent`s) — it is **not** used to read the accessibility tree. `gridhand` never inspects the tree on any platform.

## Architecture

~9,100 lines of Rust, no external crates. Each platform uses direct OS APIs:

- **Linux:** `/dev/uinput` for input via ioctl syscalls. Full D-Bus wire protocol implementation (SASL auth, message framing, type marshalling) for XDG Desktop Portal screenshots, GNOME `window-calls`, and KDE KWin scripting window management.
- **macOS:** CoreGraphics FFI (`CGEventCreateMouseEvent`, `CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent`) for input. `CGWindowListCreateImage` for screenshots. Objective-C runtime bindings for window activation.
- **Windows:** `user32.dll` (`SendInput`, `EnumWindows`, `SetForegroundWindow`, `VkKeyScanW`) and `gdi32.dll` (`BitBlt`, `GetDIBits`) for input, window management, and screenshots.

## Known limitations

- **macOS window raise** activates the owning application, not necessarily the specific window — if an app has multiple windows, the one that ends up frontmost may not be the one you targeted.
- **macOS screenshots** use `CGWindowListCreateImage`, a CoreGraphics API deprecated in macOS 14. It still works today; a ScreenCaptureKit-based backend is future work.
- **Linux desktop-size detection** uses the compositor's logical layout on GNOME (Mutter `DisplayConfig`) and KDE Plasma (KWin scripting), then falls back to a DRM-sysfs heuristic on unsupported desktops.
